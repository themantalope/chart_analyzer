# For short mornings with a mildly functioning brain
------------

Download the spreadsheet and copy/paste to do some simple analysis of lab values in the morning.
You will need to enable macros to analyze the values.

More functionality to come. Still a work in progress, so download, modify and
contribute! If you have questions with how to use git, just let me know.

Suggestions about what to include next welcome. I was planning on doing the blood gas stuff with Winter's. But also could add analysis of free water deficits, drip rates for sodium rebalance etc.

While these calculators exist elsewhere, the point of this is to simplify the workflow to copy/paste (en block) and then click a button, instead of navigating all over the place and punching values in. Suggestions on this welcome as well.

## Example usage
Copy and paste values into the spreadsheet. If your values are in a different column,
just rename the columns at the top of the spreadsheet. However the names still need to be
spelled the same, i.e. `Na`, `Cl`, `HCO3` etc.
